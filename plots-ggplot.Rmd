#Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plot sin R and it's going to be amazing.

We use the following data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Research and National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in our analyses

```{r}
#Attach packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```


```{r}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))

ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))

```

#Let's make graphs
```{r}

ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_line()

gg_base<- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))

gg_base +
  geom_point()

gg_base +
  geom_col()

gg_base +  
  geom_area()

```
